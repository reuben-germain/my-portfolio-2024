            <h1>Reuben Germain</h1>
            <h2>Junior Software Engineer & Developer</h2>

            <p>I am a person who is friendly, honest and someone who holds integrity as one of my
                highest values. I'm reliable, punctual and I work well in a team but also on my own, and I
                like to set myself goals with the aim of achieving them. I also have good listening and
                communication skills. I have a creative mind, love learning new things and embrace new
                challenges. I am well organised and always plan ahead to make sure that my time is well
                managed. I am excited and have a strong desire to make a career transition into the tech
                industry. I am a diligent learner willing to undertake training and develop new skills to meet
                the demands of the role, and am keen to work within a progressive environment offering
                scope for career developmen</p>

                with
