    <p>In 2008 a friend of mine called me and asked me to come and celebrate his 30th birthday. At this stage in my life I had retired from going to bars, clubs & partying, as I had done so much of this from a very young age (12 - 25), and had grown quite tired & no longer enjoyed that type of lifestyle. All of my friends knew that I was not interested in any of those type of social activities anymore, but friends & family alike would always ask & try to get me go come to every occasion & event under the sun, and after the age of 25 my default answer was always NO. After some persuasion & convincing, and against my better judgement, I caved in to the pressure of my friend asking me, as I started to feel bad & guilty that he really wanted me to come to celebrate his birthday, after all it had been a long time since I had gone out anywhere.</p>
    <p>So I got to the club venue, Scala in King's Cross & hooked up with my friends.</p>
